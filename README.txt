Gravity is not initially turned on. Press 'CTRL+F' to turn on gravity. The
character's position is saved, thus when you leave gravity mode to explore,
when you turn on gravity mode, you will end up at the location you were last
at when gravity was on.

Keep the mouse right button pressed to move the camera.

Extra Credit
1. Sky is drawn using a procedually-generated texture.
2. Day Night Cycle - The original time is set for the cycle to take 100
seconds. This can be increased with ']' (right bracket button ) and decreased 
with '[' (left bracket button). To make it easier for you to see, the amount
of time for the cycle is printed out to the screen. There is a moon that moves
in a parabolic motion above the camera. The sky box is interpolated in the
fragment shader to get a horizon and to gradually move from day to night.

3. The user can make modifications to the world by pressing 'R' to remove
boxes from the world, and by pressing 'T' to add boxes. The user can walk into the holes digged, and jump up to the new boxes added.
